        From the moment I wrote my first line of code, I knew that software
        development was where I belonged. My journey began with a deep

        From the moment I wrote my first line of code, I knew that software

        I currently work as an SDE Intern at BlueMango Labs, where I’ve had the
        privilege of leading projects that significantly impact user experience
        and system efficiency. One of my proudest achievements was redesigning
        the user interface for key apps, which resulted in a 25% increase in
        user retention. I also implemented Domain-Driven Design principles that
        boosted our development speed by 30%, and integrated advanced backend
        technologies that allowed our systems to handle 10x more concurrent
        users without a hitch.

        But it's not just about the code—it's about creating something
        meaningful. Whether it’s building a Trello clone to enhance team
        collaboration or developing an app that helps users save on electricity
        costs, I strive to craft solutions that are both efficient and
        user-friendly.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I’m not coding, I enjoy mentoring aspiring developers and
        contributing to open-source projects. These experiences have reinforced
        my belief that technology should be accessible and empowering for
        everyone. Outside of the tech world, you can often find me running long
        distances, where I find the solitude and rhythm help spark new ideas.
      </p>
